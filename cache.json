As a result, various training\napproaches, such as auxiliary loss functions and leveraging human feedback, are\nbeing adopted to enrich open-domain dialogue systems. One such auxiliary loss\nfunction is Bag-of-Words (BoW) loss, defined as the cross-entropy loss for\npredicting all the words/tokens of the next utterance. In this work, we propose\na novel auxiliary loss named Bag-of-Keywords (BoK) loss to capture the central\nthought of the response through keyword prediction and leverage it to enhance\nthe generation of meaningful and interpretable responses in open-domain\ndialogue systems. BoK loss upgrades the BoW loss by predicting only the\nkeywords or critical words/tokens of the next utterance, intending to estimate\nthe core idea rather than the entire response. We incorporate BoK loss in both\nencoder-decoder (T5) and decoder-only (DialoGPT) architecture and train the\nmodels to minimize the weighted sum of BoK and LM (BoK-LM) loss. We perform our\nexperiments on two popular open-domain dialogue datasets, DailyDialog and\nPersona-Chat. We show that the inclusion of BoK loss improves the dialogue\ngeneration of backbone models while also enabling post-hoc interpretability.

While learned subword\ntokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as\nlarge vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and\nsensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations,\nwe investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language\nmodelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a\nlightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word\nembeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded\nback into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains\nthe sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on\na rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion\nparameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task\nperformance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly\ngreater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued\npretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as\nfast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of\nits previously learned knowledge.

Adding good friction, such as explanations or getting\nuser confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported\ndecision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for\nLLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via\nfriction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with\ndialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM\nwith an additional accountability head, which functions as a binary classifier\nto predict the slots of the dialogue states. We perform our experiments with\nthree backbone LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Gemma) on two established task-oriented\ndatasets (MultiWOZ and Snips).

Unlike classical vector quantization and\nrate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be\nable to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product.\nSpecifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is\napplied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per\nentry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate\nmatrix product $A^\\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower\nbound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate\n$R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries.

To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a\nvisual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety\nbenchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has\nbeen revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these\nsensitive text-image queries according to textual queries.

Many of these tasks are\nperformed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for\nwhich is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix\nsharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix.\nHowever, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming\nrequests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the\nprefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache\nto reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that\nare about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache\nmanagement. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the\nrequest-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill\nchunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the\nGPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly\nidentifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix\nwill be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders\nthe requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to\nbetter mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies\nmemory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to\nincrease the GPU utilization.

This paper\nintroduces Chatty-Gen, a novel multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation\nplatform for automatically generating high-quality dialogue benchmarks tailored\nto a specific domain using a KG. Chatty-Gen decomposes the generation process\ninto manageable stages and uses assertion rules for automatic validation\nbetween stages. Our approach enables control over intermediate results to\nprevent time-consuming restarts due to hallucinations. It also reduces reliance\non costly and more powerful commercial LLMs. Chatty-Gen eliminates upfront\nprocessing of the entire KG using efficient query-based retrieval to find\nrepresentative subgraphs based on the dialogue context. Our experiments with\nseveral real and large KGs demonstrate that Chatty-Gen significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art systems and ensures consistent model and system\nperformance across multiple LLMs of diverse capabilities, such as GPT-4o,\nGemini 1.5, Llama 3, and Mistral.\n","authors":["Reham Omar","Omij Mangukiya","Essam Mansour"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09928v1.pdf","comment":"The paper is publsihed in SIGMOD 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09538v2","updated":"2025-01-17T02:35:08Z","published":"2025-01-16T13:42:09Z","title":"Analyzing Continuous Semantic Shifts with Diachronic Word Similarity\n  Matrices","summary":"  The meanings and relationships of words shift over time.

This\nquantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main\ncomponent of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed\nof loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and\nrate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be\nable to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product.\nSpecifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is\napplied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per\nentry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate\nmatrix product $A^\\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower\nbound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate\n$R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically,\nwe construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit\nguarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$\nin terms of only Frobenius norms $\\|\\bar{A}\\|_F, \\|\\bar{B}\\|_F$ and\n$\\|\\bar{A}^\\top \\bar{B}\\|_F$, where $\\bar{A},\\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$\nwith zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our\nquantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A\npractical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite\nclose to optimal.

Assuming the system possesses terrain\nmaps of the area and can estimate user locations using localization algorithms\nor direct GPS reporting, it can input these parameters into the learning\nalgorithms to achieve optimized path planning performance.

As developers\ngrow the space of tasks that such AI agents can accomplish, we will need tools\nboth to unlock their benefits and manage their risks. Current tools are largely\ninsufficient because they are not designed to shape how agents interact with\nexisting institutions (e.g., legal and economic systems) or actors (e.g.,\ndigital service providers, humans, other AI agents). For example, alignment\ntechniques by nature do not assure counterparties that some human will be held\naccountable when a user instructs an agent to perform an illegal action. To\nfill this gap, we propose the concept of agent infrastructure: technical\nsystems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate\nand influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Agent\ninfrastructure comprises both new tools and reconfigurations or extensions of\nexisting tools.

Surprisingly, previous\nworks indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to\nalign MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs trained with\nimage-text pairs. To explain such a counter-intuitive phenomenon, we discover a\nvisual safety information leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety\nbenchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky and sensitive content in the image has\nbeen revealed in the textual query. In this way, MLLMs can easily refuse these\nsensitive text-image queries according to textual queries. However, image-text\npairs without VSIL are common in real-world scenarios and are overlooked by\nexisting multimodal safety benchmarks. To this end, we construct multimodal\nvisual leakless safety benchmark (VLSBench) preventing visual safety leakage\nfrom image to textual query with 2.4k image-text pairs.

The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache\nto reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests.

Subsequently, to mitigate their sparsity\ngap, the shape information from LiDAR is used to enrich radar BEV features.\nExtensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) dataset demonstrate our\napproach's superiority over existing methods, achieving the highest mAP of\n71.76% across the entire area and 86.36\\% within the driving corridor.\nEspecially for cars, we improve the AP by 4.17% and 4.20% due to the strong\nindicative features and symmetric shapes.\n","authors":["Xiangyuan Peng","Huawei Sun","Kay Bierzynski","Anton Fischbacher","Lorenzo Servadei","Robert Wille"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10266v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ICASSP 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2","updated":"2025-01-17T15:21:52Z","published":"2024-05-07T15:14:49Z","title":"BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory\n  Recognition under Reference Frame Variations","summary":"  When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant\nto be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act\nas disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition.

Zero-shot and few-shot anomaly\ndetection do not require labeled samples from the target class in advance,\nmaking them a promising research direction. Existing zero-shot and few-shot\napproaches often leverage powerful multimodal models to detect and localize\nanomalies by comparing image-text similarity. However, their handcrafted\ngeneric descriptions fail to capture the diverse range of anomalies that may\nemerge in different objects, and simple patch-level image-text matching often\nstruggles to localize anomalous regions of varying shapes and sizes. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes the FiLo++ method, which consists of two key\ncomponents. The first component, Fused Fine-Grained Descriptions (FusDes),\nutilizes large language models to generate anomaly descriptions for each object\ncategory, combines both fixed and learnable prompt templates and applies a\nruntime prompt filtering method, producing more accurate and task-specific\ntextual descriptions. The second component, Deformable Localization (DefLoc),\nintegrates the vision foundation model Grounding DINO with position-enhanced\ntext descriptions and a Multi-scale Deformable Cross-modal Interaction (MDCI)\nmodule, enabling accurate localization of anomalies with various shapes and\nsizes.

The key idea lies in utilizing wavelet decomposition to extract\nlow-and-high frequency components from feature levels, allowing for faster\nprocessing while upholding high-quality reconstruction. The downsampling block\nemploys a novel squeeze-and-attention scheme to optimize the feature\ndownsampling process in a structurally compact manner through wavelet domain\nlearning, preserving discriminative features while discarding noise components.\nIn our upsampling block, we introduce a dual-upsample and fusion mechanism to\nenhance high-frequency component awareness, aiding in the reconstruction of\nhigh-frequency details.

However, due to insufficient\nconstraints on modeling such attention, we observe that the Localization\nAttention Maps (LAM) often struggle with the artifact issue, i.e., patch\nregions with minimal semantic relevance are falsely activated by class tokens.\nIn this work, we propose MoRe to address this issue and further explore the\npotential of LAM. Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization\non class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention\nas a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module\nto implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities.

Second, motivated by the\nobservation that CAM from classification weights maintains smooth localization\nof objects, we devise the Localization-informed Regularization module to\nexplicitly regularize the class-patch attention.

This is\nprimarily due to the weak correlation between speech and eye gaze, as well as\nthe scarcity of audio-gaze data, making it very challenging to generate 3D eye\ngaze motion from speech alone. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven\nmethod which can generate diverse 3D eye gaze motions in harmony with the\nspeech. To achieve this, we firstly construct an audio-gaze dataset that\ncontains about 14 hours of audio-mesh sequences featuring high-quality eye gaze\nmotion, head motion and facial motion simultaneously. The motion data is\nacquired by performing lightweight eye gaze fitting and face reconstruction on\nvideos from existing audio-visual datasets. We then tailor a novel\nspeech-to-motion translation framework in which the head motions and eye gaze\nmotions are jointly generated from speech but are modeled in two separate\nlatent spaces. This design stems from the physiological knowledge that the\nrotation range of eyeballs is less than that of head. Through mapping the\nspeech embedding into the two latent spaces, the difficulty in modeling the\nweak correlation between speech and non-verbal motion is thus attenuated.\nFinally, our TalkingEyes, integrated with a speech-driven 3D facial motion\ngenerator, can synthesize eye gaze motion, eye blinks, head motion and facial\nmotion collectively from speech.

This paper introduces a novel affordance\ntheory grounded in Computational Rationality, positing that humans construct\ninternal representations of the world based on bounded sensory inputs. Within\nthese internal models, affordances are inferred through two core mechanisms:\nfeature recognition and hypothetical motion trajectories. Our theory redefines\naffordance perception as a decision-making process, driven by two components:\nconfidence (the perceived likelihood of successfully executing an action) and\npredicted utility (the expected value of the outcome). By balancing these\nfactors, individuals make informed decisions about which actions to take. Our\ntheory frames affordances perception as dynamic, continuously learned, and\nrefined through reinforcement and feedback. We validate the theory via thought\nexperiments and demonstrate its applicability across diverse types of\naffordances (e.g., physical, digital, social).

This\ncomprehensive survey wishes to provide an up-to-date overview that focuses on\nlearning-based NFPPF strategies. The survey is based on the Preferred Reporting\nItems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodological flow,\nallowing for a systematic and complete literature review. In particular, we\npropose the first taxonomy that covers the learning panorama for NFPPF,\nexamining in detail the different methodologies used to increase the amount of\nmultimodal information, as well as the state-of-the-art available datasets.\nFinally, we discuss the challenges and future directions.\n","authors":["Andrea Avogaro","Luigi Capogrosso","Andrea Toaiari","Franco Fummi","Marco Cristani"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10324v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted at the Springer Nature Computer Science journal"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10322v1","updated":"2025-01-17T17:51:53Z","published":"2025-01-17T17:51:53Z","title":"Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformers: Combining Byte-~and Word-Level\n  Processing for Robust, Adaptable Language Models","summary":"  Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking\ntext into units that computational models can process. While learned subword\ntokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as\nlarge vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and\nsensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations,\nwe investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language\nmodelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a\nlightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word\nembeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded\nback into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains\nthe sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on\na rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion\nparameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task\nperformance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly\ngreater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued\npretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as\nfast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of\nits previously learned knowledge.

This limitation is\nproblematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains\ncomplex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific\nnuances requiring tailored handling.

At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent\nreasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and\nadaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution.

Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on\ntensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT\ndecomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for\nhigh-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently\nachieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space\ncomplexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices\nfor ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by\nconstructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via\nperforming chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the\nparentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices\nis an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product\nspace and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete\northogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set\n(Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for\ntheoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices\nand orthogonal equivariant bases.

Homogeneous PC allows all access points to a\nprotected region to have identical permitted inflow. However, homogeneous PC\nperforms poorly when the congestion in the protected region is heterogeneous\n(e.g., imbalanced demand) since the homogeneous PC does not consider specific\ntraffic conditions around each perimeter intersection. When the protected\nregion has spatially heterogeneous congestion, one needs to modulate the\nperimeter inflow rate to be higher near low-density regions and vice versa for\nhigh-density regions. A na\\\"ive approach is to leverage 1-hop traffic pressure\nto measure traffic condition around perimeter intersections, but such metric is\ntoo spatially myopic for PC. To address this issue, we formulate multi-hop\ndownstream pressure grounded on Markov chain theory, which ``looks deeper''\ninto the protected region beyond perimeter intersections. In addition, we\nformulate a two-stage hierarchical control scheme that can leverage this novel\nmulti-hop pressure to redistribute the total permitted inflow provided by a\npre-trained deep reinforcement learning homogeneous control policy.\nExperimental results show that our heterogeneous PC approaches leveraging\nmulti-hop pressure significantly outperform homogeneous PC in scenarios where\nthe origin-destination flows are highly imbalanced with high spatial\nheterogeneity.

This paper contrasts the conventional \"decisive\nAI x-risk hypothesis\" with an \"accumulative AI x-risk hypothesis.\" While the\nformer envisions an overt AI takeover pathway, characterized by scenarios like\nuncontrollable superintelligence, the latter suggests a different causal\npathway to existential catastrophes. This involves a gradual accumulation of\ncritical AI-induced threats such as severe vulnerabilities and systemic erosion\nof economic and political structures. The accumulative hypothesis suggests a\nboiling frog scenario where incremental AI risks slowly converge, undermining\nsocietal resilience until a triggering event results in irreversible collapse.\nThrough systems analysis, this paper examines the distinct assumptions\ndifferentiating these two hypotheses.

We also introduce a\ntrainable over-the-air sensor fusion method based on $L_p$-norm inspired\ncombining function that customizes sensor fusion to match the network and\nsensor distribution characteristics, enhancing adaptability. To address the\nenergy constraints of sensors, we utilize memristors, known for their\nenergy-efficient in-memory computing, enabling analog-domain computations that\nreduce energy use and computational overhead in edge computing. This dual\napproach of memristors and $L_p$-norm inspired sensor fusion fosters\nenergy-efficient computational and transmission paradigms and serves as a\npractical energy-efficient solution with minimal performance loss.\n","authors":["Busra Tegin","Muhammad Atif Ali","Tolga M Duman"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10245v1.pdf","comment":"34 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10240v1","updated":"2025-01-17T15:09:57Z","published":"2025-01-17T15:09:57Z","title":"Challenges and recommendations for Electronic Health Records data\n  extraction and preparation for dynamic prediction modelling in hospitalized\n  patients -- a practical guide","summary":"  Dynamic predictive modeling using electronic health record (EHR) data has\ngained significant attention in recent years.

This\nquantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main\ncomponent of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed\nof loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and\nrate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be\nable to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product.\nSpecifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is\napplied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per\nentry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate\nmatrix product $A^\\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower\nbound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate\n$R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries.

This can lead to inaccurate\nencoding, resulting in biased mined drug-disease association information. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a new model called Dual-Feature Drug\nRepurposing Neural Network (DFDRNN). DFDRNN allows the mining of two features\n(similarity and association) from the drug-disease biomedical networks to\nencode drugs and diseases.

These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix\nsharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix.\nHowever, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming\nrequests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the\nprefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache\nto reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that\nare about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache\nmanagement. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the\nrequest-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill\nchunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the\nGPU.

However, the potential for misuse of these models in activities\nsuch as plagiarism, generating fake news, and spamming has raised concern about\ntheir responsible use. Consequently, the reliable detection of AI-generated\ntext has become a critical area of research. AI text detectors have shown to be\neffective under their specific settings. In this paper, we stress-test the\nrobustness of these AI text detectors in the presence of an attacker. We\nintroduce recursive paraphrasing attack to stress test a wide range of\ndetection schemes, including the ones using the watermarking as well as neural\nnetwork-based detectors, zero shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors.\nOur experiments conducted on passages, each approximately 300 tokens long,\nreveal the varying sensitivities of these detectors to our attacks. Our\nfindings indicate that while our recursive paraphrasing method can\nsignificantly reduce detection rates, it only slightly degrades text quality in\nmany cases, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in current detection systems\nin the presence of an attacker. Additionally, we investigate the susceptibility\nof watermarked LLMs to spoofing attacks aimed at misclassifying human-written\ntext as AI-generated. We demonstrate that an attacker can infer hidden AI text\nsignatures without white-box access to the detection method, potentially\nleading to reputational risks for LLM developers.

Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that\naccounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process\nseparately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces\nspecies distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a\nlandscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the\npattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit,\noccupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's\nstatus (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant.

We present a systematic study of a\nhighway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to\nminimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging\n(ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to\nthis problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with\nsimulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal\nposition during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends\nexisting work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents)\nand does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic\nand ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established\nthat collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully\ndecentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that\ncontrollers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against\nidealized optimal controllers.\n","authors":["Larry Schester","Luis E.

Most existing KT models rely\nexclusively on human-defined knowledge concepts (KCs) associated with\nexercises. As a result, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent\non the quality and completeness of the predefined KCs. Human errors in labeling\nand the cost of covering all potential underlying KCs can limit model\nperformance.\n  In this paper, we propose a KT model, Sparse Binary Representation KT\n(SBRKT), that generates new KC labels, referred to as auxiliary KCs, which can\naugment the predefined KCs to address the limitations of relying solely on\nhuman-defined KCs. These are learned through a binary vector representation,\nwhere each bit indicates the presence (one) or absence (zero) of an auxiliary\nKC. The resulting discrete representation allows these auxiliary KCs to be\nutilized in training any KT model that incorporates KCs. Unlike pre-trained\ndense embeddings, which are limited to models designed to accept such vectors,\nour discrete representations are compatible with both classical models, such as\nBayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), and modern deep learning approaches.\n  To generate this discrete representation, SBRKT employs a binarization method\nthat learns a sparse representation, fully trainable via stochastic gradient\ndescent. Additionally, SBRKT incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) to\ncapture temporal dynamics and predict future student responses by effectively\ncombining the auxiliary and predefined KCs. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat SBRKT outperforms the tested baselines on several datasets and achieves\ncompetitive performance on others. Furthermore, incorporating the learned\nauxiliary KCs consistently enhances the performance of BKT across all tested\ndatasets.\n","authors":["Yahya Badran","Christine Preisach"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09893v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09597v2","updated":"2025-01-17T00:25:18Z","published":"2024-10-12T17:23:34Z","title":"A Complete Characterization of Learnability for Stochastic Noisy Bandits","summary":"  We study the stochastic noisy bandit problem with an unknown reward function\n$f^*$ in a known function class $\\mathcal{F}$.

Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B\nachieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7\nbillion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key\nfactors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one\nof which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers\nthe syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs\nfor code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies.

Recently, the rapid\nadvancement of large language models has demonstrated a significant potential\nto transform OMC. However, most studies have primarily focused on improving\ndiagnostic accuracy under conditions of relatively sufficient information,\nwhile paying limited attention to the \"inquiry\" phase of the consultation\nprocess.

By inputting medical records into our patient\nsimulator to simulate patient responses, we conduct extensive experiments to\nexplore the relationship between \"inquiry\" and \"diagnosis\" in the consultation\nprocess. Experimental results demonstrate that inquiry and diagnosis adhere to\nthe Liebig's law: poor inquiry quality limits the effectiveness of diagnosis,\nregardless of diagnostic capability, and vice versa.

MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on\nalmost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To\nhelp the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the\nprompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the\nselected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer,\nwhich is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the\nselected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated\nprobability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in\nthe response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer\ndepends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide\nthe reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a\nwide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more\nconfident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This\noccurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is\nthat this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the\nselected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and\nthe reasoning that supports the selection made.

In this work, we\nutilize Quora-like and YiXinLi single-round consultation models to build a\ngeneral agent framework that generates high-quality responses for single-turn\npsychological consultation scenarios. We use a bilingual dataset to evaluate\nthe quality of single-response consultations generated by each framework. Then,\nwe incorporate dynamic routing and supervisory mechanisms inspired by real\npsychological counseling to construct a CBT-oriented autonomous multi-agent\nframework, demonstrating its general applicability. Experimental results\nindicate that AutoCBT can provide higher-quality automated psychological\ncounseling services.\n","authors":["Ancheng Xu","Di Yang","Renhao Li","Jingwei Zhu","Minghuan Tan","Min Yang","Wanxin Qiu","Mingchen Ma","Haihong Wu","Bingyu Li","Feng Sha","Chengming Li","Xiping Hu","Qiang Qu","Derek F.

Despite advancements in vision-language models\n(VLMs) through large-scale training, their ability to comprehend negation\nremains underexplored. This study addresses the question: how well do current\nVLMs understand negation? We introduce NegBench, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate negation understanding across 18 task variations and 79k examples\nspanning image, video, and medical datasets. The benchmark consists of two core\ntasks designed to evaluate negation understanding in diverse multimodal\nsettings: Retrieval with Negation and Multiple Choice Questions with Negated\nCaptions. Our evaluation reveals that modern VLMs struggle significantly with\nnegation, often performing at chance level. To address these shortcomings, we\nexplore a data-centric approach wherein we finetune CLIP models on large-scale\nsynthetic datasets containing millions of negated captions.

This comprehensive\nnature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for\nhuman-computer interaction. Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known\nfor their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle\nmulti-modal inputs, including speech. Although these models can be adept at\nrecognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating\nappropriate responses.

In\nthis work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework\nfor steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by\nsampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called\nparticles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores\ncomputed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using\nrewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value\nindicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various\nchoices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK\nsteering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image\nmodels with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B\nparameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt\nfidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion\nmodels with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that\nFK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs\nand enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results\ndemonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even\nwith off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and\ncontrollability benefits.

Although\nscaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the\ntokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how\nauto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and\ndownstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of\nscaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration,\nwe replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision\nTransformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data\nconstraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder\nbottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it\nis highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is\nmore complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the\nauto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation\nperformance.

Compared to existing LLMs, aiXcoder-7B\nachieves higher code completion accuracy while having smaller scales (i.e., 7\nbillion parameters). We attribute the superiority of aiXcoder-7B to three key\nfactors: (1) Multi-objective training. We employ three training objectives, one\nof which is our proposed Structured Fill-In-the-Middle (SFIM). SFIM considers\nthe syntax structures in code and effectively improves the performance of LLMs\nfor code. (2) Diverse data sampling strategies. They consider inter-file\nrelationships and enhance the capability of LLMs in understanding cross-file\ncontexts. (3) Extensive high-quality data. We establish a rigorous data\ncollection pipeline and consume a total of 1.2 trillion unique tokens for\ntraining aiXcoder-7B. This vast volume of data enables aiXcoder-7B to learn a\nbroad distribution of code. We evaluate aiXcoder-7B in five popular code\ncompletion benchmarks and a new benchmark collected by this paper.

However, applying\nfalsification to AI-enabled control systems poses two significant challenges:\n(1)~it requires the system to execute numerous candidate test inputs, which can\nbe time-consuming, particularly for systems with AI models that have many\nparameters, and (2)~multiple safety requirements are typically defined as a\nconjunctive specification, which is difficult for existing falsification\napproaches to comprehensively cover.\n  This paper introduces Synthify, a falsification framework tailored for\nAI-enabled control systems. Our approach performs falsification in a two-phase\nprocess. At the start, Synthify synthesizes a program that implements one or a\nfew linear controllers to serve as a proxy for the AI controller. This proxy\nprogram mimics the AI controller's functionality but is computationally more\nefficient. Then, Synthify employs the $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy to sample a\npromising sub-specification from the conjunctive safety specification.

To evaluate Synthify, we\ncompare it to PSY-TaLiRo, a state-of-the-art and industrial-strength\nfalsification tool, on 8 publicly available control systems.

An intuitive alternative calls on guidance from in-the-wild\nimage exemplars to help users bring their imagined edits to life. Contemporary\nexemplar-based editing methods shy away from leveraging the rich latent space\nlearnt by pre-existing large text-to-image (TTI) models and fall back on\ntraining with curated objective functions to achieve the task. Though somewhat\neffective, this demands significant computational resources and lacks\ncompatibility with diverse base models and arbitrary exemplar count. On further\ninvestigation, we also find that these techniques restrict user control to only\napplying uniform global changes over the entire edited region. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel framework for progressive exemplar-driven editing with\noff-the-shelf diffusion models, dubbed PIXELS, to enable customization by\nproviding granular control over edits, allowing adjustments at the pixel or\nregion level.

Automated\nflower and fruit density estimation, localization, and counting could help\nstreamline harvesting, yield estimation, and crop-load management strategies\nsuch as flower and fruitlet thinning. This article proposes a deep\nregression-based network, AgRegNet, to estimate density, count, and location of\nflower and fruit in tree fruit canopies without explicit object detection or\npolygon annotation. Inspired by popular U-Net architecture, AgRegNet is a\nU-shaped network with an encoder-to-decoder skip connection and modified\nConvNeXt-T as an encoder feature extractor. AgRegNet can be trained based on\ninformation from point annotation and leverages segmentation information and\nattention modules (spatial and channel) to highlight relevant flower and fruit\nfeatures while suppressing non-relevant background features. Experimental\nevaluation in apple flower and fruit canopy images under an unstructured\norchard environment showed that AgRegNet achieved promising accuracy as\nmeasured by Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), percentage Mean Absolute Error\n(pMAE) and mean Average Precision (mAP) to estimate flower and fruit density,\ncount, and centroid location, respectively. Specifically, the SSIM, pMAE, and\nmAP values for flower images were 0.938, 13.7%, and 0.81, respectively. For\nfruit images, the corresponding values were 0.910, 5.6%, and 0.93. Since the\nproposed approach relies on information from point annotation, it is suitable\nfor sparsely and densely located objects.

Although\nscaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the\ntokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how\nauto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and\ndownstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of\nscaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank.

We next explored the effect of separately scaling the\nauto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation\nperformance.

In real-world\nscenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model\nowners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a\nsetting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a\npre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as\ncontinual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted\nknowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining\nknowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal.\n(iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially\nmissing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose\nGroup Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA\nmodules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting\ntask independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is\nadopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out\nthe others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we\nincorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a\nmore practical approach, GS-LoRA++.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues.

Traditional methods like blurring and pixelation can\nlargely remove identifying features, but these techniques significantly degrade\nimage quality and are vulnerable to deep reconstruction attacks. Generative\nmodels have emerged as a promising solution for anonymizing faces while\npreserving a natural appearance. However, many still face limitations in visual\nquality and often overlook the potential to recover the original face from the\nanonymized version, which can be valuable in specific contexts such as image\nforensics. This paper proposes a novel framework named iFADIT, an acronym for\nInvertible Face Anonymization via Disentangled Identity Transform. The\nframework features a disentanglement architecture coupled with a secure\nflow-based model: the former decouples identity information from\nnon-identifying attributes, while the latter transforms the decoupled identity\ninto an anonymized version in an invertible manner controlled by a secret key.\nThe anonymized face can then be reconstructed based on a pre-trained StyleGAN\nthat ensures high image quality and realistic facial details. Recovery of the\noriginal face (aka de-anonymization) is possible upon the availability of the\nmatching secret, by inverting the anonymization process based on the same set\nof model parameters. Furthermore, a dedicated secret-key mechanism along with a\ndual-phase training strategy is devised to ensure the desired properties of\nface anonymization.

Therefore, it is\nworth investigating how to enhance the distinction between the shadows and\nbackground. In this study, we proposed the Shadow Enhancement and Background\nSuppression for ViSAR (SE-BSFV) algorithm. The SE-BSFV algorithm is based on\nthe low-rank representation (LRR) theory and adopts online subspace learning\ntechnique to enhance shadows and suppress background for ViSAR images.

In real-world\nscenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model\nowners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a\nsetting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a\npre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as\ncontinual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted\nknowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining\nknowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal.\n(iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially\nmissing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose\nGroup Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce LoRA\nmodules to fine-tune the FFN layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting\ntask independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is\nadopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out\nthe others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we\nincorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a\nmore practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the\nlogits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the\nlogits closer to their respective prototypes.

In humans, this is evident in the ease with which\ncognate words - words similar in both orthographic form and meaning (e.g.,\nblind, meaning \"sightless\" in both English and German) - are processed,\ncompared to the challenges posed by interlingual homographs, which share\northographic form but differ in meaning (e.g., gift, meaning \"present\" in\nEnglish but \"poison\" in German). We investigate how multilingual Large Language\nModels (LLMs) handle such phenomena, focusing on English-Spanish,\nEnglish-French, and English-German cognates, non-cognate, and interlingual\nhomographs. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to disambiguate meanings\nand make semantic judgments, both when these word types are presented in\nisolation or within sentence contexts. Our findings reveal that while certain\nLLMs demonstrate strong performance in recognizing cognates and non-cognates in\nisolation, they exhibit significant difficulty in disambiguating interlingual\nhomographs, often performing below random baselines. This suggests LLMs tend to\nrely heavily on orthographic similarities rather than semantic understanding\nwhen interpreting interlingual homographs. Further, we find LLMs exhibit\ndifficulty in retrieving word meanings, with performance in isolative\ndisambiguation tasks having no correlation with semantic understanding.\nFinally, we study how the LLM processes interlingual homographs in incongruent\nsentences. We find models to opt for different strategies in understanding\nEnglish and non-English homographs, highlighting a lack of a unified approach\nto handling cross-lingual ambiguities.\n","authors":["Eshaan Tanwar","Gayatri Oke","Tanmoy Chakraborty"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09127v1.pdf","comment":"Code available at:\n  https://github.com/EshaanT/Bilingual_processing_LLMs"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09126v1","updated":"2025-01-15T20:13:46Z","published":"2025-01-15T20:13:46Z","title":"Augmenting Human-Annotated Training Data with Large Language Model\n  Generation and Distillation in Open-Response Assessment","summary":"  Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o can help automate text\nclassification tasks at low cost and scale.

In three experiments, we systematically vary LLM-generated\nsamples' size, variety, and consistency, informed by best practices in LLM\ntuning. Our findings indicate that augmenting datasets with synthetic samples\nimproves classifier performance, with optimal results achieved at an 80%\nsynthetic to 20% human-coded data ratio. Lower temperature settings of 0.3,\ncorresponding to less variability in LLM generations, produced more stable\nimprovements but also limited model learning from augmented samples.

A Case Study on\n  Stable Diffusion Bias","summary":"  Generative models are nowadays widely used to generate graphical content used\nfor multiple purposes, e.g. web, art, advertisement. However, it has been shown\nthat the images generated by these models could reinforce societal biases\nalready existing in specific contexts. In this paper, we focus on understanding\nif this is the case when one generates images related to various software\nengineering tasks. In fact, the Software Engineering (SE) community is not\nimmune from gender and ethnicity disparities, which could be amplified by the\nuse of these models. Hence, if used without consciousness, artificially\ngenerated images could reinforce these biases in the SE domain. Specifically,\nwe perform an extensive empirical evaluation of the gender and ethnicity bias\nexposed by three versions of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model (a very popular\nopen-source text-to-image model) - SD 2, SD XL, and SD 3 - towards SE tasks. We\nobtain 6,720 images by feeding each model with two sets of prompts describing\ndifferent software-related tasks: one set includes the Software Engineer\nkeyword, and one set does not include any specification of the person\nperforming the task. Next, we evaluate the gender and ethnicity disparities in\nthe generated images. Results show how all models are significantly biased\ntowards male figures when representing software engineers. On the contrary,\nwhile SD 2 and SD XL are strongly biased towards White figures, SD 3 is\nslightly more biased towards Asian figures.

This rather novel type of APIs presents new\nchallenges when it comes to properly securing the APIs against the usual web\napplication security risks, e.g., broken access control. A prominent security\ntesting approach is taint analysis, which traces tainted, i.e.,\nsecurity-relevant, data from sources (where tainted data is inserted) to sinks\n(where the use of tainted data may lead to a security risk), over the\ninformation flow in an application.\n  We present a first systematic approach to static and dynamic taint analysis\nfor Graph APIs focusing on broken access control. The approach comprises the\nfollowing. We taint nodes in the Graph API if they represent data requiring\nspecific privileges in order to be retrieved or manipulated, and identify API\ncalls which are related to sources and sinks. Then, we statically analyze\nwhether tainted information flow between API source and sink calls occurs. To\nthis end, we model the API calls using graph transformation rules. We\nsubsequently use critical pair analysis to automatically analyze potential\ndependencies between rules representing source calls and rules representing\nsink calls. We distinguish direct from indirect tainted information flow and\nargue under which conditions the CPA is able to detect not only direct, but\nalso indirect tainted flow. The static taint analysis (i) identifies flows that\nneed to be further reviewed, since tainted nodes may be created by an API call\nand used or manipulated by another API call later without having the necessary\nprivileges, and (ii) can be used to systematically design dynamic security\ntests for broken access control. The dynamic taint analysis checks if potential\nbroken access control risks detected during the static taint analysis really\noccur.

However, there are still gaps before they can be fully\napplied in actual software development processes. Accurately assessing the code\ngeneration capabilities of large language models has become an important basis\nfor evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed\ndatasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, the current\nevaluation process may encounter the illusion of \"Specialist in Familiarity\",\nprimarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and\ndependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code\nin current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the\ntraining phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM,\ntheir timeliness has been severely compromised. The key to solve the problem is\nto, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not\nencountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the\nconcept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring\nthe functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based\nbenchmark OBFUSEVAL. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world\nprojects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level\nstrategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and\ncontext dependencies.

The widespread adoption of this standard has resulted in\nthe development of many black-box testing tools that generate tests based on\nthese specifications. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nparticularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), have enhanced REST API testing\nby extracting actionable rules and generating input values from the\nhuman-readable portions of the specification. However, these advancements\noverlook the potential of continuously refining the identified rules and test\ninputs based on server responses. To address this limitation, we present\nLlamaRestTest, a novel approach that employs two custom LLMs to generate\nrealistic test inputs and uncover parameter dependencies during the testing\nprocess by incorporating server responses. These LLMs are created by\nfine-tuning the Llama3-8b model, using mined datasets of REST API example\nvalues and inter-parameter dependencies.

While techniques\nthat redirect attention have proven effective in alleviating motion sickness\nsymptoms in terrestrial environments, applying similar strategies to manage\nseasickness poses unique challenges due to the prolonged and intense motion\nenvironment associated with maritime travel. In this study, we propose a\nmindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically designed to redirect\nattention with the aim of mitigating seasickness symptoms in real-world\nsettings. Our system utilizes a single-channel headband to capture prefrontal\nEEG signals, which are then wirelessly transmitted to computing devices for the\nassessment of mindfulness states. The results are transferred into real-time\nfeedback as mindfulness scores and audiovisual stimuli, facilitating a shift in\nattentional focus from physiological discomfort to mindfulness practices. A\ntotal of 43 individuals participated in a real-world maritime experiment\nconsisted of three sessions: a real-feedback mindfulness session, a resting\nsession, and a pseudofeedback mindfulness session.

Existing\ntechniques often rely on supervised machine learning, which struggles with\ngeneralization across different programming languages and coding styles due to\nthe need for large labeled datasets. Inspired by recent advances in natural\nlanguage authorship analysis using large language models (LLMs), which have\nshown exceptional performance without task-specific tuning, this paper explores\nthe use of LLMs for source code authorship attribution.\n  We present a comprehensive study demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs can\nsuccessfully attribute source code authorship across different languages. LLMs\ncan determine whether two code snippets are written by the same author with\nzero-shot prompting, achieving a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of\n0.78, and can attribute code authorship from a small set of reference code\nsnippets via few-shot learning, achieving MCC of 0.77. Additionally, LLMs show\nsome adversarial robustness against misattribution attacks.\n  Despite these capabilities, we found that naive prompting of LLMs does not\nscale well with a large number of authors due to input token limitations. To\naddress this, we propose a tournament-style approach for large-scale\nattribution. Evaluating this approach on datasets of C++ (500 authors, 26,355\nsamples) and Java (686 authors, 55,267 samples) code from GitHub, we achieve\nclassification accuracy of up to 65% for C++ and 68.7% for Java using only one\nreference per author.

In order to resolve these shortcomings of NEATEST, this work\naims to transform the algorithm into a many-objective search algorithm that\ntargets several program states simultaneously. To this end, we combine the\nneuroevolution algorithm NEATEST with the two established search-based software\ntesting algorithms, MIO and MOSA.

This bias holds significant\nimplications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially\npromoting digital monopolies.

The need to regulate AI design, development, and use\nis strictly necessary to avoid unethical and potentially dangerous consequences\nto humans. The European Union (EU) has released a new legal framework, the AI\nAct, to regulate AI by undertaking a risk-based approach to safeguard humans\nduring interaction. At the same time, researchers offer a new perspective on AI\nsystems, commonly known as Human-Centred AI (HCAI), highlighting the need for a\nhuman-centred approach to their design. In this context, Symbiotic AI (a\nsubtype of HCAI) promises to enhance human capabilities through a deeper and\ncontinuous collaboration between human intelligence and AI. This article\npresents the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that aims to\nidentify principles that characterise the design and development of Symbiotic\nAI systems while considering humans as the core of the process. Through content\nanalysis, four principles emerged from the review that must be applied to\ncreate Human-Centred AI systems that can establish a symbiotic relationship\nwith humans.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nguided by prompt engineering have gained attention for their ability to handle\na broad range of tasks, including unit test generation. Despite their success,\nLLMs may exhibit hallucinations when generating unit tests for focal methods or\nfunctions due to their lack of awareness regarding the project's global\ncontext. These hallucinations may manifest as calls to non-existent methods, as\nwell as incorrect parameters or return values, such as mismatched parameter\ntypes or numbers. While many studies have explored the role of context, they\noften extract fixed patterns of context for different models and focal methods,\nwhich may not be suitable for all generation processes (e.g., excessive\nirrelevant context could lead to redundancy, preventing the model from focusing\non essential information). To overcome this limitation, we propose RATester,\nwhich enhances the LLM's ability to generate more repository-aware unit tests\nthrough global contextual information injection. To equip LLMs with global\nknowledge similar to that of human testers, we integrate the language server\ngopls, which provides essential features (e.g., definition lookup) to assist\nthe LLM. When RATester encounters an unfamiliar identifier (e.g., an unfamiliar\nstruct name), it first leverages gopls to fetch relevant definitions and\ndocumentation comments, and then uses this global knowledge to guide the LLM.\nBy utilizing gopls, RATester enriches the LLM's knowledge of the project's\nglobal context, thereby reducing hallucinations during unit test generation.\n","authors":["Xin Yin","Chao Ni","Xinrui Li","Liushan Chen","Guojun Ma","Xiaohu Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07425v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09536v2","updated":"2025-01-13T15:25:37Z","published":"2024-08-18T16:44:01Z","title":"Galapagos: Automated N-Version Programming with LLMs","summary":"  N-Version Programming is a well-known methodology for developing\nfault-tolerant systems.

This algorithm is extensively adopted in\ntest input minimization and software debloating. Recently, ProbDD, an advanced\nvariant of ddmin, has been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance.\nEmploying Bayesian optimization, ProbDD predicts the likelihood of each element\nin L being essential, and statistically decides which elements and how many\nshould be removed each time. Despite its impressive results, the theoretical\nprobabilistic model of ProbDD is complex, and the specific factors driving its\nsuperior performance have not been investigated. In this paper, we conduct the\nfirst in-depth theoretical analysis of ProbDD, clarifying trends in probability\nand subset size changes while simplifying the probability model. Complementing\nthis analysis, we perform empirical experiments, including success rate\nanalysis, ablation studies, and analysis on trade-offs and limitations, to\nbetter understand and demystify this state-of-the-art algorithm. Our success\nrate analysis shows how ProbDD addresses bottlenecks of ddmin by skipping\ninefficient queries that attempt to delete complements of subsets and\npreviously tried subsets. The ablation study reveals that randomness in ProbDD\nhas no significant impact on efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose\nCDD, a simplified version of ProbDD, reducing complexity in both theory and\nimplementation. Besides, the performance of CDD validates our key findings.\nComprehensive evaluations across 76 benchmarks in test input minimization and\nsoftware debloating show that CDD can achieve the same performance as ProbDD\ndespite its simplification.

It serves as one of the primary\ntools for describing the spatial dynamics of the brain using various\nneuroimaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the distribution rules or potential\nmodes of functional connectivity weights in the resting state remain unclear.\nIn this context, we first start from simulation, using forward solving model to\ngenerate scalp EEG with four channel densities (19, 32, 64, 128). Subsequently,\nwe construct scalp brain networks using five coupling measures, aiming to\nexplore whether different channel density or coupling measures affect the\ndistribution pattern of functional connectivity weights. Next, we quantify the\ndistribution pattern by calculating the skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy\nof the functional connectivity network weights. Finally, the results of the\nsimulation were validated in a normative database. We observed that: 1) The\nfunctional connection weights exhibit a right-skewed distribution, and are not\ninfluenced by channel density or coupling measures; 2) The functional\nconnection weights exhibit a relatively uniform distribution, with the\npotential for volume conduction to affect the degree of uniformity in the\ndistribution; 3) Networks constructed using coupling measures influenced by\nvolume conduction exhibit significant correlations between the average\nconnection weight and measures of skewness, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy.

To address this issue, we introduce ChartEditor, a human-AI\npaired tool that transforms basic charts into pictorial versions based on user\nintent. ChartEditor decomposes chart images into visual components and\norganizes them within a hierarchical tree. Based on this tree, users can\nexpress their intent in natural language, which is then translated into\nmodifications to the hierarchy. In addition, users can directly interact with\nand modify specific chart components via an intuitive interface to achieve\nfine-grained design control.

We tested these methods in two conditions: one in which\nparticipants remained stationary and one in which they walked freely alongside\nthe robot. We hypothesized that walking alongside the robot would result in\nhigher intuitiveness ratings and improved task performance, based on the idea\nthat walking promotes spatial alignment and reduces the effort required for\nmental rotation. In a 2x2 within-subject design, 218 participants guided the\nquadruped robot Spot along a circuitous route with multiple 90-degree turns\nusing rotate left, rotate right, and walk forward commands. After each trial,\nparticipants rated the intuitiveness of the command mapping, while\npost-experiment interviews were used to gather the participants' preferences.\nResults showed that voice control combined with walking with Spot was the most\nfavored and intuitive, whereas gesture control while standing caused confusion\nfor left/right commands. Nevertheless, 29% of participants preferred gesture\ncontrol, citing increased task engagement and visual congruence as reasons. An\nodometry-based analysis revealed that participants often followed behind Spot,\nparticularly in the gesture control condition, when they were allowed to walk.\nIn conclusion, voice control with walking produced the best outcomes.

Minimizing Interaction Samples for Configurable\n  Systems","summary":"  Modern software systems are typically configurable, a fundamental\nprerequisite for wide applicability and reusability. This flexibility poses an\nextraordinary challenge for quality assurance, as the enormous number of\npossible configurations makes it impractical to test each of them separately.\nThis is where t-wise interaction sampling can be used to systematically cover\nthe configuration space and detect unknown feature interactions. Over the last\ntwo decades, numerous algorithms for computing small interaction samples have\nbeen studied, providing improvements for a range of heuristic results;\nnevertheless, it has remained unclear how much these results can still be\nimproved.\n  We present a significant breakthrough: a fundamental framework, based on the\nmathematical principle of duality, for combining near-optimal solutions with\nprovable lower bounds on the required sample size. This implies that we no\nlonger need to work on heuristics with marginal or no improvement, but can\ncertify the solution quality by establishing a limit on the remaining gap; in\nmany cases, we can even prove optimality of achieved solutions. This\ntheoretical contribution also provides extensive practical improvements: Our\nalgorithm SampLNS was tested on 47 small and medium-sized configurable systems\nfrom the existing literature. SampLNS can reliably find samples of smaller size\nthan previous methods in 85% of the cases; moreover, we can achieve and prove\noptimality of solutions for 63% of all instances. This makes it possible to\navoid cumbersome efforts of minimizing samples by researchers as well as\npractitioners, and substantially save testing resources for most configurable\nsystems.\n","authors":["Dominik Krupke","Ahmad Moradi","Michael Perk","Phillip Keldenich","Gabriel Gehrke","Sebastian Krieter","Thomas Th√ºm","S√°ndor P.

Dynamic linking waits until runtime to calculate an\napplication's relocation mapping, i.e., the mapping between each externally\nreferenced symbol in the application to the dependency that provides the\nsymbol. Unfortunately, it comes with two downsides. First, dynamic linking\nlimits the performance of current systems since it can take seconds to\ncalculate a relocation mapping for a large program. Second, dynamic linking\nlimits the dependency management of applications since it prevents a developer\nfrom accurately observing a relocation mapping except at runtime.\n  This paper makes the key insight that the benefits conventionally attributed\nto dynamic linking: code reuse, streamlined software updates, and reduced\ndisk/network use are actually benefits of shared libraries. Thus, we present\nstable linking, a new mechanism for using dependencies that uses shared\nlibraries to retain their benefits but eliminates the downsides of dynamic\nlinking. Stable linking separates a system's state into management times; when\nthe system can be modified, and epochs when it cannot. Stable linking\ncalculates each application's relocation mapping at the beginning of each\nepoch, allows developers to inspect the relocation mapping during the epoch,\nand reuses the mapping for subsequent executions in the epoch. We design and\nbuild MatR, the first stable linker. We use MatR in three workloads and show\nthat it improves upon dynamic linking performance by a factor of 2.19 on\naverage. Additionally, we use the system in three vignettes, or case-studies,\nthat illustrate the system's improvements to dependency management.\n","authors":["Farid Zakaria","Andrew Quinn","Thomas R. W.

This is due to the\nlimitations of Global Navigation and Satellite Systems, which do not operate in\nnon-line-of-sight environments. Depending on their architecture, ITS can rely\non expensive infrastructure, accumulate errors, or be challenging to evaluate\nin real-life environments. Building an ITS is a complex process that involves\ndevising, evaluating and fine-tuning tracking algorithms. This process is not\nyet standard, as researchers use different types of equipment, deployment\nenvironments, and evaluation metrics. Therefore, it is challenging for\nresearchers to build novel tracking algorithms and for the research community\nto reproduce the experiments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose MobiXIM, a framework that provides a\nset of tools for devising, evaluating and fine-tuning tracking algorithms in a\nstructured manner. For devising tracking algorithms, MobiXIM introduces a novel\nplugin architecture, allowing researchers to collaborate and extend existing\nalgorithms.

Text-to-Image (T2I) software, one of the most widely used, synthesizes\nimages with text input by engaging in a cross-modal process. However, despite\nsubstantial advancements in the T2I engine, T2I software still encounters\nerrors when generating complex or non-realistic scenes, including omitting\nfocal entities, low image realism, and mismatched text-image information. The\ncross-modal nature of T2I software complicates error detection for traditional\ntesting methods, and the absence of test oracles further exacerbates the\ncomplexity of the testing process. To fill this gap, we propose ACTesting, an\nAutomated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software, the first\ntesting method explicitly designed for T2I software. ACTesting utilizes the\nmetamorphic testing principle to address the oracle problem and identifies\ncross-modal semantic consistency as its fundamental Metamorphic relation (MR)\nby employing the Entity-relationship (ER) triples. We design three kinds of\nmutation operators under the guidance of MR and the adaptability density\nconstraint to construct the new input text. After generating the images based\non the text, ACTesting verifies whether MR is satisfied by detecting the ER\ntriples across two modalities to detect the errors of T2I software. In our\nexperiments across five popular T2I software, ACTesting effectively generates\nerror-revealing tests, resulting in a decrease in text-image consistency by up\nto 20% when compared to the baseline. Additionally, an ablation study\ndemonstrates the efficacy of the proposed mutation operators.

FunC is the most popular programming language for writing smart contracts\non TON. It is distinguished by a unique syntax compared to other smart contract\nlanguages. Despite growing interest, research on the practical defects of TON\nsmart contracts is still in its early stages. In this paper, we summarize eight\nsmart contract defects identified from TON's official blogs and audit reports,\neach with detailed definitions and code examples. Furthermore, we propose a\nstatic analysis framework called TONScanner to facilitate the detection of\nthese defects. Specifically, TONScanner reuses FunC compiler's frontend code to\ntransform the FunC source code into FunC intermediate representation (IR) in\nthe form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on this IR, TONScanner\nconstructs a control flow graph (CFG), then transforms it into a static single\nassignment (SSA) form to simplify further analysis. TONScanner also integrates\nData Dependency, Call Graph, Taint Analysis, and Cell Construct, which are\nspecifically tailored for TON blockchain's unique data structures. These\ncomponents finally facilitate the identification of the eight defects. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of TONScanner by applying it to 1,640 smart\ncontracts and find a total of 14,995 defects. Through random sampling and\nmanual labeling, we find that TONScanner achieves an overall precision of\n97.49%. The results reveal that current TON contracts contain numerous defects,\nindicating that developers are prone to making errors.

In open source software (OSS) ecosystems, essential tasks that do\nnot involve code (like content moderation) often become invisible to the\ndetriment of individuals and organizations. However, invisible labor is\nsufficiently difficult to measure that we do not know how much of OSS\nactivities are invisible. Our study addresses this challenge, demonstrating\nthat roughly half of OSS work is invisible. We do this by developing a\ncognitive anchoring survey technique that measures OSS developer\nself-assessments of labor visibility and attribution. Survey respondents\n(n=142) reported that their work is more likely to be invisible (2 in 3 tasks)\nthan visible, and that half (50.1%) is uncompensated. Priming participants with\nthe idea of visibility caused participants to think their work was more\nvisible, and that visibility was less important, than those primed with\ninvisibility. We also found evidence that tensions between attribution\nmotivations probably increase how common invisible labor is. This suggests that\nadvertising OSS activities as \"open\" may lead contributors to overestimate how\nvisible their labor actually is. Our findings suggest benefits to working with\nvaried stakeholders to make select, collectively valued activities visible, and\nincreasing compensation in valued forms (like attribution, opportunities, or\npay) when possible.

Previous models for\nvoice interactions are categorized as native and aligned. Native models\nintegrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues\nlike differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training. Aligned models\nmaintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a\nnarrow focus on speech tasks. In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice\ninteraction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal\nmodels. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment,\ntext-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction\nalignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of\nspeech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation\nwhile maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates\nfull-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between\nthe user and the system. Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder\nthat outperforms prior models in voice generation. The enhanced\ninstruction-following capabilities of MinMo supports controlling speech\ngeneration based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions,\ndialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices. For MinMo, the\nspeech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is\napproximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice. The MinMo project web page\nis https://funaudiollm.github.io/minmo, and the code and models will be\nreleased soon.\n","authors":["Qian Chen","Yafeng Chen","Yanni Chen","Mengzhe Chen","Yingda Chen","Chong Deng","Zhihao Du","Ruize Gao","Changfeng Gao","Zhifu Gao","Yabin Li","Xiang Lv","Jiaqing Liu","Haoneng Luo","Bin Ma","Chongjia Ni","Xian Shi","Jialong Tang","Hui Wang","Hao Wang","Wen Wang","Yuxuan Wang","Yunlan Xu","Fan Yu","Zhijie Yan","Yexin Yang","Baosong Yang","Xian Yang","Guanrou Yang","Tianyu Zhao","Qinglin Zhang","Shiliang Zhang","Nan Zhao","Pei Zhang","Chong Zhang","Jinren Zhou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06282v1.pdf","comment":"Work in progress.

Recent\nstudies have identified integrating robots into families' routines and rituals\nas a promising approach to support long-term adoption. However, few studies\nexplored the integration of robots into family routines and there is a gap in\nsystematic measures to capture family preferences for robot integration.\nBuilding upon existing routine inventories, we developed Family-Robot Routines\nInventory (FRRI), with 24 family routines and 24 child routine items, to\ncapture parents' attitudes toward and expectations from the integration of\nrobotic technology into their family routines. Using this inventory, we\ncollected data from 150 parents through an online survey. Our analysis\nindicates that parents had varying perceptions for the utility of integrating\nrobots into their routines. For example, parents found robot integration to be\nmore helpful in children's individual routines, than to the collective routines\nof their families.

However, human feedback can often be noisy,\ninconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such\nfeedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended\nside effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore\nthe use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the\nperformance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation\nmethod that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward\nmodels and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate\ntwo key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of\nlabeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine\ntheir strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the\nimpact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions\ncan enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in\nRLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

Although autonomous\nwheelchairs significantly reduce user effort, they still require human input to\nallow users to maintain control and adapt to changing environments. Brain\nComputer Interface (BCI) stands out as a highly user-friendly option that does\nnot require physical movement. Current BCI systems can understand whether users\nwant to accelerate or decelerate, but they implement these changes in discrete\nspeed steps rather than allowing for smooth, continuous velocity adjustments.\nThis limitation prevents the systems from mimicking the natural, fluid speed\nchanges seen in human self-paced motion. The authors aim to address this\nlimitation by redesigning the perception-action cycle in a BCI controlled\nrobotic system: improving how the robotic agent interprets the user's motion\nintentions (world state) and implementing these actions in a way that better\nreflects natural physical properties of motion, such as inertia and damping.\nThe scope of this paper focuses on the perception aspect. We asked and answered\na normative question \"what computation should the robotic agent carry out to\noptimally perceive incomplete or noisy sensory observations?\" Empirical EEG\ndata were collected, and probabilistic representation that served as world\nstate distributions were learned and evaluated in a Generative Adversarial\nNetwork framework.
